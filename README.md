# Vue3 Vite Pinia Exam

Frontend
Vue3 + Typescript + Vite + Pinia + Vue Router

Backend
TypeScript + Express + Mongoose + MongoDB

## ðŸ˜Ž Introduction

I created a backend API made with NodeJs Express Typescript and use a dummy/public API in frontend.
Basically the users are created in mongodb database (MongoDB Atlas) and the backend API is fetching the user from the public API and return the user info and token in login.

What I am showcasing here is a can create a full-stack application with different tooling, environments and testing while I can integrate third-party APIs and microservices.

Note: Please Read README.md inside subdirectories for best practices and features

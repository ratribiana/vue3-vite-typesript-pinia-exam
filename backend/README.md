## âš’ How to Install

Go to the backend directory and install the dependencies:

$ cd backend
$ yarn install or npm install
```
## Project Setup/Configuration

Before starting the project, make sure to set up the database credentials in the `.env.development` file. Check the contents of  `.env-example` for reference

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
yarn dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
yarn build
```

### Run Unit Tests

```sh
yarn test
```

### To add seed data directly to database just follow this format

```sh
yarn seed ${model} <number> [type(optional)] [role(optional)]
yarn seed roles 1 newrole NewRole
yarn seed users 1 users users
```

### To clear and clean the test users
